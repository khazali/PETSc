/* Purpose */
/* ======= */

/* This subroutine attempts to find a permutation for an MxN, M>=N, */
/* sparse matrix A = {a_ij} that makes the permuted matrix have N */
/* entries on its diagonal. */
/* If the matrix is structurally nonsingular, the subroutine optionally */
/* returns a permutation that maximizes the smallest element on the */
/* diagonal, maximizes the sum of the diagonal entries, or maximizes */
/* the product of the diagonal entries of the permuted matrix. */
/* For the latter option, the subroutine also finds scaling factors that */
/* may be used to scale the matrix so that the nonzero diagonal entries */
/* of the permuted matrix are one in absolute value and all the */
/* off-diagonal entries are less than or equal to one in absolute value. */
/* The natural logarithms of the scaling factors u(i), i=1..M, for the */
/* rows and v(j), j=1..N, for the columns are returned so that the */
/* scaled matrix B = {b_ij} has entries b_ij = a_ij * EXP(u_i + v_j). */
/* The scaling factors are returned by this subroutine, but the actual */
/* scaling of the matrix has to be performed by the calling program. */

/* Parameters */
/* ========== */


/* JOB is an PETSCINT variable which must be set by the user to control */
/* the action. It is not altered by the subroutine. */
/* Possible values for JOB are: */
/*   1 Compute a column permutation of the matrix so that the */
/*     permuted matrix has as many entries on its diagonal as possible. */
/*     The values on the diagonal are of arbitrary size. HSL subroutine */
/*     MC21A/MC64Z is used for this. See [1]. */
/*   2 Compute a column permutation of the matrix so that the smallest */
/*     value on the diagonal of the permuted matrix is maximized. */
/*     See [3]. */
/*   3 Compute a column permutation of the matrix so that the smallest */
/*     value on the diagonal of the permuted matrix is maximized. */
/*     The algorithm differs from the one used for JOB = 2 and may */
/*     have quite a different performance. See [2]. */
/*   4 Compute a column permutation of the matrix so that the sum */
/*     of the diagonal entries of the permuted matrix is maximized. */
/*     See [3]. */
/*   5 Compute a column permutation of the matrix so that the product */
/*     of the diagonal entries of the permuted matrix is maximized */
/*     and vectors to scale the matrix so that the nonzero diagonal */
/*     entries of the permuted matrix are one in absolute value and */
/*     all the off-diagonal entries are less than or equal to one in */
/*     absolute value. See [3]. */
/*  Restriction: 1 <= JOB <= 5. */

/* M is an PETSCINT variable which must be set by the user to the */
/*   number of rows of the matrix A. It is not altered by the */
/*   subroutine. Restriction: M >= N. */

/* N is an PETSCINT variable which must be set by the user to the */
/*   number of columns of the matrix A. It is not altered by the */
/*   subroutine. Restriction: N >= 1. */

/* NE is an PETSCINT variable which must be set by the user to the */
/*   number of entries in the matrix. It is not altered by the */
/*   subroutine. Restriction: NE >= 1. */

/* IP is an PETSCINT array of length N+1. */
/*   IP(J), J=1..N, must be set by the user to the position in array IRN */
/*   of the first row index of an entry in column J. IP(N+1) must be set */
/*   to NE+1. It is not altered by the subroutine. */

/* IRN is an PETSCINT array of length NE. */
/*   IRN(K), K=1..NE, must be set by the user to hold the row indices of */
/*   the entries of the matrix. Those belonging to column J must be */
/*   stored contiguously in the positions IP(J)..IP(J+1)-1. The ordering */
/*   of the row indices within each column is unimportant. Repeated */
/*   entries are not allowed. The array IRN is not altered by the */
/*   subroutine. */

/* A is a DOUBLE PRECISION array of length NE. */
/*   The user must set A(K), K=1..NE, to the numerical value of the */
/*   entry that corresponds to IRN(K). */
/*   It is not used by the subroutine when JOB = 1. */
/*   It is not altered by the subroutine. */

/* NUM is an PETSCINT variable that need not be set by the user. */
/*   On successful exit, NUM will be the number of entries on the */
/*   diagonal of the permuted matrix. */
/*   If NUM < N, the matrix is structurally singular. */

/* PERM is an PETSCINT array of length M that need not be set by the */
/*   user. On successful exit, PERM can be interpreted in any of the */
/*   following ways: */

/*   1. If M=N, PERM contains the column permutation. */
/*      Column PERM(I) of the original matrix is column I in the */
/*      permuted matrix, I=1..N. */
/*      (This was the definition of parameter CPERM in versions of */
/*      MC64AD before version 1.2b) */

/*   2. If M>=N, PERM contains the row permutation. */
/*      Row I of the original matrix is row ABS(PERM(I)) in the */
/*      permuted matrix, I=1..M. */
/*      The rows where PERM(I) is positive constitute an N by N matrix */
/*      the scaled version of which has ones on the diagonal. */

/* LIW is an PETSCINT variable that must be set by the user to */
/*   the dimension of array IW. It is not altered by the subroutine. */
/*   Restriction: */
/*     JOB = 1 :  LIW >=  4N +  M */
/*     JOB = 2 :  LIW >=  2N + 2M */
/*     JOB = 3 :  LIW >=  8N + 2M + NE */
/*     JOB = 4 :  LIW >=  3N + 2M */
/*     JOB = 5 :  LIW >=  3N + 2M */

/* IW is an PETSCINT array of length LIW that is used for workspace. */

/* LDW is an PETSCINT variable that must be set by the user to the */
/*   dimension of array DW. It is not altered by the subroutine. */
/*   Restriction: */
/*     JOB = 1 :  LDW not used */
/*     JOB = 2 :  LDW >=      M */
/*     JOB = 3 :  LDW >=          NE */
/*     JOB = 4 :  LDW >=     2M + NE */
/*     JOB = 5 :  LDW >= N + 2M + NE */

/* DW is a REAL array of length LDW used for workspace. */
/*   If JOB = 5, on return, DW(i) contains u_i, i=1..M, and */
/*   DW(M+j) contains v_j, j=1..N. */

/* ICNTL is an PETSCINT array of length NICNTL. */
/*   Its components control the output of MC64AD and must be set by the */
/*   user before calling MC64AD. They are not altered by the subroutine. */

/*   ICNTL(1) must be set to specify the output stream for */
/*   error messages. If ICNTL(1) < 0, messages are suppressed. */

/*   ICNTL(2) must be set by the user to specify the output stream for */
/*   warning messages. If ICNTL(2) < 0, messages are suppressed. */

/*   ICNTL(3) must be set by the user to specify the output stream for */
/*   diagnostic messages. If ICNTL(3) < 0, messages are suppressed. */

/*   ICNTL(4) must be set by the user to a value other than 0 to avoid */
/*   checking of the input data.  Setting ICNTL(4) to any */
/*   other will avoid the checks but is likely to cause problems */
/*   later if out-of-range indices or duplicates are present. */
/*   The user should set ICNTL(4) nonzero, if the data is known not */
/*   to contain such problems. The code will exhibit undefined */
/*   behaviour in case data checking is not done and the */
/*   input data does not satisfy the restrictions as listed */
/*   elsewhere. */

/*   ICNTL(5) must be set by the user to control the printing of */
/*   diagnostic messages. */
/*   If ICNTL(5) <= 0, no messages are output. */
/*   If ICNTL(5) = 1, only error messages are output. */
/*   If ICNTL(5) = 2, error and warning messages output. */
/*   If ICNTL(5) = 3, as for 2 plus scalar parameters, the first */
/*   ten entries of array parameters, and the control parameters on */
/*   the first entry. */
/*   If ICNTL(5) > 3, full data will be printed on entry and exit. */

/* CNTL is a DOUBLE PRECISION array of length NCNTL. */
/*   Its components control the output of MC64AD and must be set by the */
/*   user before calling MC64AD. They are not altered by the subroutine. */

/*   CNTL(1) must be set to specify the relaxation parameter. */
/*   It is used by MC64 only if JOB = 3,4,5. */
/*   It must be set to a non-negative value (usually close to zero). */
/*   If CNTL(1) < 0.0, it is treated as 0.0. */

/*   CNTL(1) is a relaxation parameter. A positive value will lead to */
/*   matchings computed by MC64AD that are not optimal/maximal in some */
/*   sense but only nearly so. However, these non-optimal matchings are */
/*   often computed more quickly. Appropriate values for CNTL(1) are */
/*   problem dependent but usually slightly larger than 0.0. */


/* INFO is an PETSCINT array of length NINFO which need not be set by the */
/*   user. INFO(1) is set non-negative to indicate success. A negative */
/*   value is returned if an error occurred, a positive value if a */
/*   warning occurred. INFO(2) holds further information on the error. */
/*   On exit from the subroutine, INFO(1) will take one of the */
/*   following values: */
/*    0 : successful entry (for structurally nonsingular matrix). */
/*   +1 : successful entry (for structurally singular matrix). */
/*   +2 : the returned scaling factors are large and may cause */
/*        overflow when used to scale the matrix. */
/*        (For JOB = 4,5 entries only.) */
/*   +4 : CNTL(1) is negative and treated as zero. */
/*   -1 : JOB < 1 or JOB > 5.  Value of JOB held in INFO(2). */
/*   -2 : N < 1.  Value of invalid N held in INFO(2). */
/*   -3 : NE < 1.  Value of NE held in INFO(2). */
/*   -4 : M < N. Value of M held in INFO(2). */
/*   -6 : entries are found whose row indices are out of range. INFO(2) */
/*        contains the position in arrays A/IRN in which first entry is found. */
/*        (This value can be returned only if ICNTL(4) was set to zero.) */
/*   -7 : repeated entries are found. INFO(2) contains the position in arrays */
/*        A/IRN in which first entry is found. */
/*        (This value can be returned only if ICNTL(4) was set to zero.) */

/*   A return with one of the values INFO(1)=+3,+5,+6,+7 is also possible */
/*   These values are combinations of the above warnings (+1,+2,+4) and */
/*   correspond to the sum of the constituent warnings. */

/*   INFO(3) to INFO(NINFO) are not currently used and are set to zero */
/*        by the routine. */

/*  Purpose */
/*  ======= */

/* This subroutine attempts to find a column permutation for an NxN */
/* sparse matrix A = {a_ij} that makes the permuted matrix have N */
/* entries on its diagonal. */
/* If the matrix is structurally nonsingular, the subroutine optionally */
/* returns a column permutation that maximizes the smallest element */
/* on the diagonal, maximizes the sum of the diagonal entries, or */
/* maximizes the product of the diagonal entries of the permuted matrix. */
/* For the latter option, the subroutine also finds scaling factors */
/* that may be used to scale the matrix so that the nonzero diagonal */
/* entries of the permuted matrix are one in absolute value and all the */
/* off-diagonal entries are less than or equal to one in absolute value. */
/* The natural logarithms of the scaling factors u(i), i=1..N, for the */
/* rows and v(j), j=1..N, for the columns are returned so that the */
/* scaled matrix B = {b_ij} has entries b_ij = a_ij * EXP(u_i + v_j). */

/*  Parameters */
/*  ========== */


/* JOB is an PETSCINT variable which must be set by the user to */
/* control the action. It is not altered by the subroutine. */
/* Possible values for JOB are: */
/*   1 Compute a column permutation of the matrix so that the */
/*     permuted matrix has as many entries on its diagonal as possible. */
/*     The values on the diagonal are of arbitrary size. HSL subroutine */
/*     MC21A/AD is used for this. See [1]. */
/*   2 Compute a column permutation of the matrix so that the smallest */
/*     value on the diagonal of the permuted matrix is maximized. */
/*     See [3]. */
/*   3 Compute a column permutation of the matrix so that the smallest */
/*     value on the diagonal of the permuted matrix is maximized. */
/*     The algorithm differs from the one used for JOB = 2 and may */
/*     have quite a different performance. See [2]. */
/*   4 Compute a column permutation of the matrix so that the sum */
/*     of the diagonal entries of the permuted matrix is maximized. */
/*     See [3]. */
/*   5 Compute a column permutation of the matrix so that the product */
/*     of the diagonal entries of the permuted matrix is maximized */
/*     and vectors to scale the matrix so that the nonzero diagonal */
/*     entries of the permuted matrix are one in absolute value and */
/*     all the off-diagonal entries are less than or equal to one in */
/*     absolute value. See [3]. */
/*  Restriction: 1 <= JOB <= 5. */

/* N is an PETSCINT variable which must be set by the user to the */
/*   order of the matrix A. It is not altered by the subroutine. */
/*   Restriction: N >= 1. */

/* NE is an PETSCINT variable which must be set by the user to the */
/*   number of entries in the matrix. It is not altered by the */
/*   subroutine. */
/*   Restriction: NE >= 1. */

/* IP is an PETSCINT array of length N+1. */
/*   IP(J), J=1..N, must be set by the user to the position in array IRN */
/*   of the first row index of an entry in column J. IP(N+1) must be set */
/*   to NE+1. It is not altered by the subroutine. */

/* IRN is an PETSCINT array of length NE. */
/*   IRN(K), K=1..NE, must be set by the user to hold the row indices of */
/*   the entries of the matrix. Those belonging to column J must be */
/*   stored contiguously in the positions IP(J)..IP(J+1)-1. The ordering */
/*   of the row indices within each column is unimportant. Repeated */
/*   entries are not allowed. The array IRN is not altered by the */
/*   subroutine. */

/* A is a DOUBLE PRECISION array of length NE. */
/*   The user must set A(K), K=1..NE, to the numerical value of the */
/*   entry that corresponds to IRN(K). */
/*   It is not used by the subroutine when JOB = 1. */
/*   It is not altered by the subroutine. */

/* NUM is an PETSCINT variable that need not be set by the user. */
/*   On successful exit, NUM will be the number of entries on the */
/*   diagonal of the permuted matrix. */
/*   If NUM < N, the matrix is structurally singular. */

/* CPERM is an PETSCINT array of length N that need not be set by the */
/*   user. On successful exit, CPERM contains the column permutation. */
/*   Column ABS(CPERM(J)) of the original matrix is column J in the */
/*   permuted matrix, J=1..N. For the N-NUM  entries of CPERM that are */
/*   not matched the permutation array is set negative so that a full */
/*   permutation of the matrix is obtained even in the structurally */
/*   singular case. */

/* LIW is an PETSCINT variable that must be set by the user to */
/*   the dimension of array IW. It is not altered by the subroutine. */
/*   Restriction: */
/*     JOB = 1 :  LIW >= 5N */

/*     JOB = 3 :  LIW >= 10N + NE */
/*     JOB = 4 :  LIW >= 5N */

/* IW is an PETSCINT array of length LIW that is used for workspace. */

/* LDW is an PETSCINT variable that must be set by the user to the */

/*   Restriction: */
/*     JOB = 1 :  LDW is not used */
/*     JOB = 2 :  LDW >= N */
/*     JOB = 3 :  LDW >= NE */
/*     JOB = 4 :  LDW >= 2N + NE */
/*     JOB = 5 :  LDW >= 3N + NE */

/* DW is a DOUBLE PRECISION array of length LDW */
/*   that is used for workspace. If JOB = 5, on return, */
/*   DW(i) contains u_i, i=1..N, and DW(N+j) contains v_j, j=1..N. */

/* ICNTL is an PETSCINT array of length 10. Its components control the */
/*   output of MC64A/AD and must be set by the user before calling */
/*   MC64A/AD. They are not altered by the subroutine. */

/*   ICNTL(1) must be set to specify the output stream for */
/*   error messages. If ICNTL(1) < 0, messages are suppressed. */
/*   The default value set by MC46I/ID is 6. */

/*   ICNTL(2) must be set by the user to specify the output stream for */
/*   warning messages. If ICNTL(2) < 0, messages are suppressed. */
/*   The default value set by MC46I/ID is 6. */

/*   ICNTL(3) must be set by the user to specify the output stream for */
/*   diagnostic messages. If ICNTL(3) < 0, messages are suppressed. */
/*   The default value set by MC46I/ID is -1. */

/*   ICNTL(4) must be set by the user to a value other than 0 to avoid */
/*   checking of the input data. */
/*   The default value set by MC46I/ID is 0. */

/* INFO is an PETSCINT array of length 10 which need not be set by the */
/*   user. INFO(1) is set non-negative to indicate success. A negative */
/*   value is returned if an error occurred, a positive value if a */
/*   warning occurred. INFO(2) holds further information on the error. */
/*   On exit from the subroutine, INFO(1) will take one of the */
/*   following values: */
/*    0 : successful entry (for structurally nonsingular matrix). */
/*   +1 : successful entry (for structurally singular matrix). */
/*   +2 : the returned scaling factors are large and may cause */
/*        overflow when used to scale the matrix. */
/*        (For JOB = 5 entry only.) */
/*   -1 : JOB < 1 or JOB > 5.  Value of JOB held in INFO(2). */
/*   -2 : N < 1.  Value of N held in INFO(2). */
/*   -3 : NE < 1. Value of NE held in INFO(2). */
/*   -4 : the defined length LIW violates the restriction on LIW. */
/*        Value of LIW required given by INFO(2). */
/*   -5 : the defined length LDW violates the restriction on LDW. */
/*        Value of LDW required given by INFO(2). */
/*   -6 : entries are found whose row indices are out of range. INFO(2) */
/*        contains the index of a column in which such an entry is found. */
/*   -7 : repeated entries are found. INFO(2) contains the index of a */
/*        column in which such entries are found. */
